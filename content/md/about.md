# "where am i?"

well, you arrived at my.. little "lab" i would call it.

this is where i'll publish some cool projects or articles made by me.

so have a look, stay as long as you want, and feel free to contact me at anytime really üòä

# "ok.. but.. who are you?"

oh right, sorry, forgot to introduce myself!

> tl;dr - the whole following story is just my freestyle writing, and it does not describe my entire skillset.

> if that is what you're interested in - skip this, just checkout my [resume](https://weizman.github.io/website/content/pdf/cv.pdf)!

my name is [Gal Weizman](http://www.weizmangal.com).

i first started working with code in high school, studying in a computer science class.
there we were introduced with code for the first time.

we wrote some projects in `C#`, even though i can't really say i remember much.

i first got into coding serving in the israeli military in a well known cyber unit.
there i acquired many skills, mostly regarding information security.

first i was introduced with `python`, writing some basic automation utils and systems.

after doing that for a bit less than a year, i was introduced with THE WEB,
which is pretty much when i developed a strong passion to web development, web security and `javascript` (üòç).

i started off with maintaining some simple security-related `javascript` code snippets,
but quit quickly moved on to "one man" development and maintenance of a very complicated client side (and server side, `PHP`) system,
which became central in our unit in not too long (once again, security related) for almost 2 years.

later on, after leaving the army, i came back to work there as a civilian,
asked to lead the creation of the new version ("GEN 2" if you will) of that system i created before, which i did for 6 months.

by that point i became quit good in `javascript`.
i understood important parts of the language's core and its tricks and quirks.
but i wanted more. i wanted to learn more, and to become an expert in `javascript`.

so i started working in [uponit](https://uponit.com/) as their first employee.
uponit was founded by 5 guys, all served in the same unit i did, in a department specializing in `javascript` and web security.
they created a product that was able to bypass [adblock extensions](https://getadblock.com/),
and by that recover ads that were blocked and recover publishers lost revenue.
their product was (and maybe still is) the best one in the market, mostly because of their major experience with `javascript` and web security.

so for a year i built with them this amazing and complicated product and learned from them.
by that time i became quit an expert when it comes to client side `javascript`.

i learned how to de-obfuscate and reverse engineer any `javascript` code.
i learned the small yet important differences between different browsers.
i learned many terms and concepts in the web security world, and even found a few vulnerable bugs in different web applications along the way üòâ.

after a year i left uponit. i wanted to travel and have a break from our day to day lives.
i traveled through South and Central America for 9 months, and lived in Central America for 6 more months.

it was a long "code free" period of time,
except for a few minor projects i (kind of) did throughout the travel ([stylib](https://github.com/weizman/stylib))

after returning from my (long) trip, i decided i want to take my `javascript` and research abilities to the next level.
so i started working in [perimeterX](https://www.perimeterx.com) - a company which created a bot detecting tool, which is based on a lot of
web security knowledge and deep `javascript` understanding.
hopefully this job will provide me with the right environment to keep on learning and developing, personally and professionally üòä.

# so.. yea. hope you like my stuff! feel free to shoot me a message any time, including PRs!
